He spearheaded the initiative to get our global team moving onto Agile methodology for the multitude of work requests coming in. Aaron has been the resource many departments come to for issues with data, with integration of systems, with ideas that need exploring. He has been intimately involved on many of our customer data integration efforts over the years and demonstrated his expertise of analyzing, developing and maintaining the mapping or troubleshooting of customer information and the flows between Oracle, Salesforce, Informatica and Icertis. It is my sincere hope that whichever organization Aaron ends up in will appreciate his dedication and incredible work ethic. He has shown a consistency and performance that far outstrips his current job level. He has been the critical linchpin in many efforts going on in this company, and a true stabilizing force on a team that has a very difficult load to handle, and ideally that will be rewarded sometime in the future."
